Q2) REGULARIZED LOGISTIC REGRESSION

The folder contains the following functions -

1.)  plotData.m             : To plot dataset for Part 1 of question
2.)  sigmoid.m              : To compute sigmoid function of given input
3.)  computeCost.m          : To compute cost function for logistic regression using given parameters W.
4.)  gradientDescent.m      : To perform iterative gradient descent on learned parameters W.
5.)  NewtonRaphson.m        : To perform iterative Newton Raphson optimization on learned parameters W.
6.)  featureTransform.m     : To transform features to higher degree to incorporate higher order polynomial terms of the input features.
7.)  logisticRegression.m   : To implement regularized logistic regression at higher degree features.
8.)  plotDecisionBoundary.m : To plot decision boundaries as obtained in different cases of Logistic Regression.
9.)  Overfitting.m          : To give an example of overfitting and underfitting.
10.) checkAccuracy.m        : To check accuracy of the learned model on a given dataset. 

The final test script is Q2.m

How To Run :

In the Matlab window type - Q2

The code will pause after implementing each part and enter key needs to be pressed as and when displayed on the output window.
